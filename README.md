# OzRunwayConnector
FSX-P3D-MSFS to OzRunways Connector
By Robert Graham
Rob@RobGraham.info

This Connector is released to allow others to continue development on it in the future, it is not allowed to be 
monetized in any shape or form, you already pay a OZRunways Subscription to use OzRwy, this simply sends data
from the Flight Simulator to the Simulator mode of the Flight Bag.

No Support is offered for this, Currently to use with MSFS you'll need to install the FSX simconnect Library
I might get a MSFS specific version done 'soon'.

Enjoy
